A plugin for inserting DOI metadata into a post for automatic discovery of DOI information.

## Description

This plugin provides a sidebar field which allows you to associate a DOI with a post, a series of meta elements to a post HEAD, and adds a series of XML namespaces to a site. These additions allow for the automatic discovery of DOI information associated with a post.

This plugin supports [Git Updater](https://git-updater.com/).

### Caveats

- You may only associate one DOI per post.
- DOIs are not verified for correctness.

## Support

This plugin is mostly an experiment, if there is enough of a response I may devote more resources to it.
However, at this time I offer no support for this plugin.
